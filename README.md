# react-angular-single-spa-example

An example I replicated for future personal references of Joel Dennings github with [single-spa] (https://github.com/joeldenning/simple-single-spa-webpack-example/blob/master/README.md). Check out [the docs](https://github.com/CanopyTax/single-spa) and [the guide](https://medium.com/@joeldenning/a-step-by-step-guide-to-single-spa-abbbcb1bedc6)

This will help future references with my team.

## How to use it
1. Clone this project
2. `yarn install` (or `npm install`)
3. `yarn watch` (or `npm run watch`)
4. Open up http://localhost:8080 in a web browser.
